## Introduction
We focus on the voltage issues caused by volatile and intensity of data center power demand, which also aligns with recent observations of more frequent voltage disturbances in power grids. To address these data center integration challenges, we propose a dynamic voltage control scheme by harnessing data center's load regulation capabilities. By taking local voltage measurements and adjusting power injections at each data center buses through the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) scheme, we are able to maintain safe voltage magnitude in a distributed fashion with higher data center computing load. Simulations using real large language model (LLM) inference load validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.
